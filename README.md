# The Key

The Key is a todo app based on Jim Rohn's goal setting method. It helps you set and achieve your goals using S.M.A.R.T. criteria and personal development principles.

## Description

Jim Rohn was a motivational speaker and author who taught people how to achieve success in life and business. He believed that setting goals was a key factor in personal development and fulfillment. He developed a simple and effective approach to goal setting that involved four steps:

1. Evaluate and reflect. The first step is to assess your current situation and level of satisfaction in various areas of your life, such as health, finances, relationships, career, etc. This will help you identify what you want to improve or change in the future.
2. Define your dreams and goals. The second step is to write down your dreams and goals for each area of your life. You should be specific, realistic, and positive about what you want to achieve. You should also decide your "why", which is the reason or purpose behind your goals.
3. Make your goals S.M.A.R.T. The third step is to make sure your goals are S.M.A.R.T., which stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This means that your goals should be clear, quantifiable, realistic, aligned with your values, and have a deadline.
4. Have accountability. The fourth step is to share your goals with someone who can support you and hold you accountable for taking action. You should also review your goals regularly and track your progress. You should celebrate your achievements and learn from your setbacks.

Jim Rohn also suggested dividing your goals into three categories: financial, material, and skills. Financial goals are related to your income, savings, investments, etc. Material goals are related to the things you want to own or experience, such as a car, a house, a vacation, etc. Skills goals are related to the abilities you want to develop or improve, such as learning a language, playing an instrument, mastering a software, etc.

The Key app helps you follow Jim Rohn's goal setting method by letting you:

- Define your goals in different areas of your life and divide them into different time frames (1 year, 3 years,
5 years or 10 years).
- Make your goals S.M.A.R.T., specifying the details and metrics of each goal.
- Specify the reasons and motivations behind each goal.
- Determine who you are or who you need to be to achieve each goal.
- Review your goals regularly and track your achievements.
- Share your goals with others who can support you and hold you accountable.

The Key app is more than just a todo app. It's a personal development tool that helps you create a vision for
your future and take action towards making it a reality.
